# Description <a name="description"></a>
This package is for connecting and controlling an LG Therma V heat pump with Homeassistant via modbus.  
This manual is tested with:
- LG Therma V Monoblock 9kW (@basti242)

# Basics  <a name="basics"></a>
The LG Heatpump is only availiable to communicate via RS485/Modbus TCP . The best way to connect them with Homeassistant is a Modbus TCP Gateway.
For example a [Waveshare Industrial RS232/RS485 to Ethernet Converter](https://www.waveshare.com/rs232-485-to-eth-for-eu.htm).

With this integration, you are able to controll nearly all settings of your heatpump.  

**Examples**

Download the [*modbus_lg_heatpump.yaml*](https://github.com/basti242/homeassistant_lg_therma_v_modbus/blob/main/modbus_lg_heatpump.yaml)

Put the file in a folder named *integrations*. Create the folder if not exist.



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b85ebb60-3963-4d8f-8c68-fa098d60591b)


Add a reference to your integration folder in your *configuration.yaml*. The *homeassistant:* line should be still there.
```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named integrations
```

Set the secrets in your *secrets.yaml* file

```yaml
# LG Heatpump
#-----------------------------------------------
lg_heatpump_modbus_host_ip: 10.10.1.xxx #change it to the IP adress from your gateway
lg_heatpump_modbus_port: 502
lg_heatpump_modbus_slave: 1
```
Restart your Homeassistant

Here is a code example for the UI.
```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: input_select.hp_set_operation_mode
    name: Operation Mode
  - entity: input_select.hp_set_control_method
    name: Control Mode
  - entity: input_number.hp_dhw_target_temperatur
    name: Brauchwasser
    icon: kuf:sani_water_hot
```
should look like this

**Hardware settings**  
Wire connection between heatpump and gateway.  
Inside the heatpump you will find a connector named "3rd PARTY CONTROLLER". This is the connector for the modbus wire. The wire must be connected to contact A (+) and B(-).

Dip switch inside the heatpump
*Settings for 4er series*  
On the main bord of the heatpump are 2 dip switch banks, SW1 and SW2.
For us are the settings from SW1 important.  

SW1 dip 1 - ON --> The heat pump is set as a Modbus slave device.  
SW1 dip 2 - ON --> The heat pump is using a open protokoll.

**Software settings**  
It is also required to set some options on the inside LG head unit (LG RS3).
